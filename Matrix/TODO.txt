Positioning tail and head of an edge:

# Simpliest solution is to always draw from the south of the source node to the north of the sink node for FCDs

# A better? solution will position the tail of a {yes} edge at the west of the source node and a {no} at the east. 

  1. Add to Link a source position and sink position

      ".south", ".north", ".west", ".east" and "" where "" means that TikZ will figure out position

  2. Link::toString() will add those positions when a link is generated.
