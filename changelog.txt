A string table named nametable has been added that maps each
name/string constant to an unsigned integer that is used to represent
the name/string internally. The files string_table.h and
string_table.cpp provide an initial implementation of string table.

The program state is now named state and is now a map from internal
variable name (unsigned integer) to a value (integer, float, bool or
a function pointer).
 
AST nodes for binary arithmetic operations have been merged into one
class operator_node instead of multiple classes each for one operator. 

operators:
	% is added
	equality comparasion is changed to  =
	assignment operator is changed to   :=
